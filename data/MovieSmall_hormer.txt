i think they are trying to get some attention#oh (scorn) good luck look at these bills (reading) "chain for elephant" "shots for elephant" "oversized decorative poncho"
technically it is for a giraffe but i think i can let it out a little#well these bills'll have to be paid out of your allowance
you will have to raise my allowance to about a thousand dollars a week#then that is what i will do smart guy
we will pay you money#for the ninth time no

int milhouse's house)#um milhouse saw the elephant twice and rode him once right ?
yes but we paid you four dollars#well that was under our old price structure under our new price structure your bill comes to a total of seven hundred dollars now you have already paid me four dollars so that is just six hundred and ninetysix dollars more that you owe me

dad i think he is an ivory dealer his boots are ivory his hat is ivory and i am pretty sure that check is ivory#lisa a guy who has lots of ivory is less likely to hurt stampy than a guy whose ivory supplies are low
dad you can not do this stampy is my friend#(sympathetically) do not worry son i will get you a new elephant
i will take that one too#done
all right i will be back in the morning to pick up stampy#here's the keys

well perhaps i was being a tad glib let me explain our elementary school participates in a foreign exchange program now normally a student is selected on the basis of academic excellence or intelligence but in bart's case i am prepared to make a big exception and if you are willing to play along he can spend the next three months studying far far away#sounds great although a kid can not learn much in just three months
oh when he is totally immersed in a foreign language the average child can become fluent in weeks#yeah but what about bart ?
i am sure he will pick up enough to get by and the whole thing will not cost you a dime as long you are willing to take in a student of your own#wait a minute skinner how do we know some principal over in france is not pulling the same scam you are ?
well for one thing you would not be getting a french boy you would be getting an albanian#you mean all white with pink eyes ?

oh okay#did you see that ? you know marge this is the way i have always wanted it to be we have become a fully functioning family unit we have always blamed ourselves but i guess it is pretty clear which cylinder wasn't firing

way to go lis#yeah thanks lisa
over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore  while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping#huh ?
as of someone gently rapping rapping at my chamber door#(dismissing) 'tis some visitor
i muttered# tapping at my chamber door  only this and nothing more
 sorrow for the lost lenore #oh lenore
for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore  nameless here for evermore#aag
and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me  filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating#(terrified chanting rapidly) 'tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door  this it is and nothing more
presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer#(nervously and obsequiously) sir 
 said i # or madam truly your forgiveness i implore but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping and so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door that i scarce was sure i heard you
back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning soon again i heard a tapping something louder than before#(shrieks) surely 
 said i # surely that is something at my window lattice let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore 
open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door  perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door  perched and sat and nothing more#(chuckles then friendly) though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou 
i said # art sure no craven ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore  tell me tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's plutonian shore
then methought the air grew denser perfumed by some unseen censer#ouch censer
swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor#(pleading) wretch 
i cried # thy god hath lent thee  by these angels he hath sent thee (getting teary) respite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore
nevermore#(another annoyed grunt then) be that word our sign of parting bird or fiend
i shrieked of starting#get thee back into the tempest and the night's plutonian shore oh leave no black plume as a token of the lie thy soul hath spoken leave my loneliness unbroken  quit the bust above my door take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door
nevermore#take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door
nevermore#why you little 
uhoh#come back here now raven
int marge & homer's room)#oh no marge come on please

what do you think homer ?#i will tell you what i think i think he thinks (screaming) i am an idiot the only reason he is offering us this is because he knows he is gonna lose the trial and have to pay us a cool million
oh i feel faint#(derisive) "five hundred thousand dollars" i spit on his five hundred thousand dollars
(to homer) she sounded like she was taking that awful seriously#(whining) oh the truth
i am sorry but my mother always said "if you can not say anything nice do not say anything at all"#(to hutz) will that hold up in court ?
well to be honest he seemed a lot more concerned about wrapping bart in bandages than in making him feel better and he mispronounced words that even i know like abdomen and his office was dirty now that i think about it i am not sure he is even a doctor#(annoyed grunt)
but your lawyer  assuming he is a lawyer  is asking for a million ? (to jury) well we can not blame them for trying can we thank you very much mrs simpson#(sobbing) oh marge
